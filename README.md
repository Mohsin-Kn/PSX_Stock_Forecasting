# PSX Stock Forecasting 

This project leverages a deep learning approachâ€”specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networkâ€”to predict the future stock price movements of **OGDC.KA**, the ticker symbol for Oil & Gas Development Company Limited listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). By analyzing historical data comprising daily Open, High, Low, and Close (OHLC) prices along with trading volume, the model captures complex temporal patterns and trends inherent in financial markets to deliver robust next-day price predictions.
